    Hey y'all, my name's Prima! I am currently an undergraduate student studying
    Graphic Information Technology. My main focus with my studies is to get my
    foot in the door with UI/UX design. What better way to do that, than to
    craft a portfolio website (like, the one you are on right now...) from
    scratch? <br />
    <br />
    I have had a blast crafting this site and finally putting my creative skills
    to good use. Getting familiar with industry-utilized applications like
    Figma, while teaching myself the foundations of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
    have all been so insightful. Not only that, but my personal productivity
    levels have skyrocketed! This website will continue to grow and evolve, as
    will I, as time goes on. Thanks for following along. <br />
    <br />
    Lots of Love, <br />
    Prima :3
